This folder contains data files and R analysis scripts for the neurochemical data produced in the project "Nitrergic signalling in an animal model for post-traumatic stress disorder". Data were collected on adult zebrafish exposed to either conspecific alarm substance (CAS) or distilled water (CTRL). Tissue or ECF samples were processed according to the following protocols:
* [Extracellular fluid extraction in zebrafish brain tissue and samples](https://www.protocols.io/view/extracellular-fluid-extraction-in-zebrafish-brain-14egn3p1zl5d/v1)
* [Optimized protocol for quantification of nitrite levels in brain and head kidney tissue samples in adult zebrafish](https://www.protocols.io/view/optimized-protocol-for-quantification-of-nitrite-l-eq2lydzorlx9/v1)
* [Determination of aminoacids in liquid samples](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2012.07.027)


The following files can be found in this folder:
* [General metadata, with a list of the data "resources" that make up the package (online location, variable description)](https://github.com/lanec-unifesspa/no-ptsd/blob/main/neurochemistry/datapackage.json)
* [Datafile for the timecourse of changes in glutamate concentration in the extracellular fluid of the zebrafish forebrain after CAS exposure](https://github.com/lanec-unifesspa/no-ptsd/blob/main/neurochemistry/glu-timecourse.csv)
* [Datafile for the timecourse of changes in nitrite levels in tissue samples from the zebrafish forebrain after CAS exposure](https://github.com/lanec-unifesspa/no-ptsd/blob/main/neurochemistry/NOX-timecourse.csv)
* [Datafile for the role of NOS-2 in the changes in nitrite levels in the forebrain 30 min and 90 min after CAS exposure](https://github.com/lanec-unifesspa/no-ptsd/blob/main/neurochemistry/NOX_forebrain.csv)
* [Datafile for the role of NOS-2 in the changes in nitrite levels in the head kidney 30 min and 90 min after CAS exposure](https://github.com/lanec-unifesspa/no-ptsd/blob/main/neurochemistry/NOX_headkidney.csv)
* [R script to reproduce the statistical analyses of the data](https://github.com/lanec-unifesspa/no-ptsd/blob/main/neurochemistry/neurochemistry_tds_analysis.R)
