This folder contains data files and R analysis scripts for the behavioral pharmacological data produced in the project "Nitrergic signalling in an animal model for post-traumatic stress disorder". In this folder, data from experiments using ODQ are found. Data were collected on adult zebrafish exposed to either conspecific alarm substance (CAS) or distilled water (CTRL). Animals were injected with either vehicle (VEH) or 7-NI (7NI). The following protocols were used:
* [Extraction of alarm substance in zebrafish](https://www.protocols.io/view/extraction-of-alarm-substance-in-zebrafish-14egnxzjml5d/v1)
* [Light/dark preference test in adult zebrafish](https://www.protocols.io/view/light-dark-preference-test-for-adult-zebrafish-dan-bp2l65yzgqe5/v1)


The following files can be found in this folder:
* [General metadata, with a list of the data "resources" that make up the package (online location, variable description)](https://github.com/lanec-unifesspa/no-ptsd/blob/main/behavior/ODQ/datapackage.json)
* [Datafile for the beavioral effects of ODQ on time-dependent sensitization in zebrafish treated 30 min after CAS exposure](https://github.com/lanec-unifesspa/no-ptsd/blob/main/behavior/ODQ/ODQ30.csv)
* [Datafile for the beavioral effects of ODQ on time-dependent sensitization in zebrafish treated 90 min after CAS exposure](https://github.com/lanec-unifesspa/no-ptsd/blob/main/behavior/ODQ/ODQ90.csv)
* [R script to reproduce the statistical analyses of the data](https://github.com/lanec-unifesspa/no-ptsd/blob/main/behavior/ivabradine/behavpharmIVA.R)
